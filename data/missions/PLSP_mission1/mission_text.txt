After years of fighting this seemingly weak and decaying foreign force, the Sindrian Diktat only found that it seemed to underestimate its tenacity. It had all began with a desire to covet the untapped resources of Triglav, and the arrogant belief that they could easily overpower the seemingly conservative forces stationed there.

Aside from the chaos, small-scale conflicts outside the frontal battlefield are much easier to handle for experienced Sindrian commanders.

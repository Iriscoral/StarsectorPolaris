In yet another day in the the sectorï¼Œfreelancing Captain Pulotin was bringing warships from the black market of those bright blue forces - Ludd knows why they didn't notice the existence of this kind of thing in an unreasonable place - and a cargo ship to Chicomoztoc.

Throughout this overly peaceful journey, his high self-confidence and the many thoughts of how he could spend the bountiful profit from the contract had reduced Pultion's usual guard - until the high alert rang. Immediately, the Captain reacted by demanding his lieutenant for reports.

The sensor suite showed an array of red dots surrounding his fleet, and the fact that none of them could be hailed merely underlined how bad the situation was.

To make matters worse, for a bunch of pirates, their equipment were advanced compared to their peers, and they were clearly prepared for this attack.

Yet, there was an asteroid field ahead...as long as they could reach there, everything would be fine...at least, that was what the Captain thought.

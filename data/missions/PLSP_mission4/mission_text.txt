Date: 205.8.3

A Polaris Task Force on an logistics supply mission was heading to the supply point of the Zagan Star System. Under the influence of the Coral Nebula at the edge of the galaxy, the formation of this fleet became disconnected, and the commander's negligence and carelessness led to the subsequent tragedy.

Another fleet waiting here launched a surprise attack from both sides, cutting off the task force. Although the ambusher's transponder was turned off, Polaris intelligence immediately identified them as belonging to Tri-Tachyon.

Everyone on the communication channel immediately realized that they were responsible for the small-scale fleet disappearances that occasionally occurred during these years, and that in the near future, an infamous force known as the "Striker Mercenary" would have a batch of poorly redesiged Polaris vessels. This group of private pirates is inextricably linked to that blue corporation...

But, it was too late, the communication channels to the outside world had been disrupted, and all the escort vessels were sunk in the next few minutes, leaving only the last battlecruiser, unscathed for the time being. In fact, that Axis-Class Battlecruiser was precious enough that the ambush fleet had hoped to salvage with minimal damage.

However, its captain, Scyathea, a shining protege of the North Celestial Akademia, obviously did not intend to accept this imposed fate.

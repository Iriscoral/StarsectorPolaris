Location: Edge of the Triglav Star System
Date: 200.2.27

The short-term battle originally planned between the Sindrian Diktat and Polaris has eventually evolved into a drawn out tug-of-war between the two states.

Just a few months ago, Diktat forces planned another large-scale operation to retake possession of the space around Veles to force a breakthrough in the stalemate. However, this plan was known to Polaris who prepared a counter in advance.

Shortly after the Sindrian fleet entered Triglav through the wormhole jump, the Polaris Dawn Line task force appeared not far away. However, Admiral Hokander, commanding officer of the Diktat force, did not bother with this relatively small fleet, because it was small in size compared to the previous fleet he had encountered.

He had not realized that the fleet was highly elite and the auxiliary ships hidden in its formation had never appeared before in the war. In fact, instead of defending Triglav, Polaris had defined this engagement as a test of those ships' capabilities.

The task force is well prepared and ready for everything they meet now.

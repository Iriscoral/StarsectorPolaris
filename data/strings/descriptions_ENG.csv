PLSP_electgenerator,WEAPON,"Using the simplest of linear accelerators and a hard-to-measure capacitor bank, the Charge Generator can deliver a short burst of hard-to-avoid firepower, making it particularly suited to mid-range engagements.",Assault,,
PLSP_electemitter,WEAPON,"With the aid of several cyclotron accelerators concealed beneath the casing, this advanced device continously fires a pulsed particle beam composed of nuclei, hitting the target before any effective evasive action can be performed.",Assault,,
PLSP_electprojecter,WEAPON,"The most significant improvement for the Charge Projector over other versions of its weapon series is the replacement of the staging device with a large set of flux shunts, which minimizes the need for buffering and preloading.",Assault,,
PLSP_impulses,WEAPON,"This torpedo is demonstrative of Polaris' love of linear accelerator concept. Designed to fire a high-powered kinetic warhead at tremendous speeds, it is capable of taking down shields at the inevitable point of impact.",Strike,,
PLSP_impulsem,WEAPON,"A larger launch platform for the Impulse Torpedo, the larger magazine size and asynchronous launch design allows for more effective overloading of shields with a single volley.",Strike,,
PLSP_impulsel,WEAPON,"This launcher features an advanced version of the Impulse Torpedo, which has been fitted with a more destructive warhead and a larger fuel tank for greater range and endurance. ",Strike,,
PLSP_pulsehp,WEAPON,"A pulse cannon capable of firing a large number of heavy particle clusters in a short interval. The radiant nature of the ordnance fired makes it more suitable for dismantling armor and superstructures rather than shields, or for covering assaults.",Assault,,
PLSP_pulseo,WEAPON,"The Superimposed Pulse Cannon is a relatively simple improvement on the Particle Pulse Cannon, using better capacitors alongside improvements to its guidance and targeting system, which significantly improves the killing ability of each targeted burst.",Assault,,
PLSP_pulsesc,WEAPON,"Most of its users do not know what kind of interpretation of ""supercritical"" applies here, but this does not affect the extremely high effectiveness of this magnificent weapon. The greatly improved single damage ability as compared to its predecessors means that even the heaviest armor will also be torn apart in a few shots of its fire.",Assault,,
PLSP_etherstrike,WEAPON,"The unique built-in weapon marked as ""Heaven and Earth"" in Axis-Class Battlecruiser's weapon system, it brutally destroys enemies with a quadruple high energy burst shot accelerated to unimaginable levels via its built in emitter.",Strike,,
PLSP_guidingpds,WEAPON,This point defense weapon uses a special field effect extension accelerator to shoot out polarized energy clusters at extremely high speeds. The field effect also allows the weapon to control the trajectory of its projectile to induce tracking on their targets.,Point Defense,,
PLSP_guidingpdm,WEAPON,"An upscaled version of Polaris' mainstay point defense system, the main differences being an enlarged linear acceleration cavity and additional field-effect accelerators, allowing for more powerful and more accurate projectiles.",Point Defense,,
PLSP_guidingpdl,WEAPON,"The largest and most definite version of Polaris' point defense systems, this upscaled and upgraded version boasts multiple field controllers of variable sizes, a series of heavy duty field-effect accelerator arrays, combined secondary acceleration units, all mounted on high-torque composite servomotors. All these upgrades combined on a single weapon allows it to demonstrate top-tier point defense interception. ",Point Defense,,
PLSP_streammicrowave,WEAPON,"A relatively new development in Polaris's arsenal that makes use of unique laser technology to create suppressive pseudo-beam weapons. The energy buffered in the capacitor banks is injected into a series of laser generators, and the resulting flux energy is then pumped through microtubules that are placed throughout the weapon to generate a particle jet.",Close Support,,
PLSP_streampolarization,WEAPON,"A heavier version of the Microwave Plasma Rifle. In addition to a larger capacitor bank and denser flux energy microtubes, an optimized spectral redirection protocol allows it to project a cleaner, more destructive particle jet.",Close Support,,
PLSP_streaminvert,WEAPON,"An improved version of Polaris's Particle Rifle technology. Part specifications for large weapon adaptations allow the laser's resonant cavity to be used for energy reserves as well. The multiple counter-feedback effects during the energy transition explode into a torrent of energy that, if not properly controlled, can tear apart space-time.",Close Support,,
PLSP_iccannon,WEAPON,"A newly developed point defense weapon making use of unusual ammuntion. Beads of monocrystalline metallic hydrogen is compressed to a quasi-critical state, creating an unstable rhombohedral-shaped projectile which is then fired. Upon hitting the target, the projectile shatters, covering a large area with numerous deadly crystal fragments with high kinetic energy.",Point Defense,,
PLSP_icflak,WEAPON,"This version of the Crystal Autocannon employs a higher mass pre-processing load, allowing for larger projectiles that can break up into bigger pieces. As noted in the name, the fragmented shards of each crystal ammo will still retain a large amount of momentum after shattering, allowing them to shatter again and cover a wider area.",Point Defense,,
PLSP_icculverin,WEAPON,"These massive weapons, featuring the largest deployments of Polaris crystal technology, utilize large linear accelerators to propell solid blocks of hydrogen of extreme macro-stable mass, creating a chaotic storm of crystals that will tear apart any shield structure.",Area Defense,,
PLSP_interferometerhyperbolic,WEAPON,"Weaponised ray generators that deploys one set of photons at a time and utilize them it to blast the target in a bizarre path, wrecking heavy damage to light armour or small enough hulls.","Suppression",,
PLSP_interferometerresonant,WEAPON,"Using the resonance technique under macro particles, the accelerating poles with additional wave energy components are able to excite two projectiles in parallel to form a projection wave, while still maintaining a level of accuracy comparable to that of a laser weapon.","Suppression",,
PLSP_interferometerdegeneracy,WEAPON,"The diffraction component operating in regression mode can excite a large group of effective projectiles at once, burning any solid structural material with a semi-random state, exhibitig a phenomenon similar to ball lightning.","Suppression",,
PLSP_magnetics,WEAPON,"The warheads are loaded with traces of high-density exotic material, which on approach to the target cause them to fuse directionally and produce extremely powerful rays, magnetic fields and high-energy charged jets. Due to safety and cost considerations, a single MIRV does not carry the amount of materal required to trigger a gamma-ray burst.","Strike",,
PLSP_magneticm,WEAPON,"The Magnetar-Class warhead, although the size of a drone, is the most potent explosive-pumped ray emitter of its size, housing two sets of four units of gravitational decay vessels that maintain the stability of the dense material and produce a more violent electromagnetic torrent.","Strike",,
PLSP_magneticl,WEAPON,"To compensate for the fact that even large shipboard slots are not meant to carry the Magnetar-class warhead, this version of the design instead extends the holding inwards, devoting more internal volume to accommodating extended launchers and inertial-free loaders for greater saturation through any defence.","Strike",,

PLSP_redshiftw,WEAPON,"A special pulse laser with shocking power and very high flux efficiency, only limited for range.",Assault,,
PLSP_blueshiftw,WEAPON,Ejects a large number of graviton shells with a collapse effect that can cause devastating blows to shields and electronic equipments.,Assault,,
PLSP_nebulablaze,WEAPON,"Embedded main weapon of the fighter, the swift projectile has a powerful destructive power similar to a heavy blaster.",Assault,,
PLSP_perturbationw,WEAPON,"A triplet of energy missiles with excellent range, charged and delivered by a concentrator ring located in the center of the bomber.",Bombard,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
PLSP_perturbation,SHIP,"This slow energy bomber fires pulses based on an adsorptive micro carrier, utilising a ring shaped concentrator embedded in the centre of it body to trigger an explosive release, so as to allow it to perform all its bombing attacks from a safe distance.

In order to compensate for the structural defects in its frame caused by the installation of the pulse ring, it has a built-in damping force field to prevent its untimely self-immolation.",,,
PLSP_redshift,SHIP,"These expensive heavy fighters, ridiculously over-armed and equipped with integrated displacer systems, make them extremely suitable for dealing with large targets, and they are also capable of intercepting other fighters.

Overall, this difficult-to-match heavy firepower design has demonstrates the Polaris's strikecraft doctrine of focusing on quality rather than quantity.",,,
PLSP_blueshift,SHIP,"A light fighter focused on speed and shield capabilities, protecting its fragile structures with the most comprehensive of shielding systems. Rather than causing direct damage, its armaments are more suitable for locking down ships with heavy EMP damage.

The designers somehow managed to add a Vortex Drive in the front area of the engine despite its small size - though this means the fighter requires a significantly longer logistics trail.",,,
PLSP_comettail,SHIP,"In contrast to the usual practice of overwhelming enemy aircraft with numbers or defending missiles with high-precision strikes, this aircraft takes the simplest and most direct approach to clearing a large area, leaving no opportunity for any fish caught in the metaphorical net to emerge.

It was originally intended to take advanced fighters with strong shields down than the current design of the Sector, which carries heavy armor.",,,
PLSP_occultation,SHIP,"This assault aircraft combines defense and counterattack roles by mounting a compact version of the Borealis Shroud, allowing it to support its fellow fighters by hardening their shields and increasing their survivability.

Its built-in weapon was originally named the Pulse Wave Emitter, but most captains agreed that it needed a more distinctive codename.",,,
PLSP_moonphase,SHIP,"One of the responses of the Fleet Joint Defense doctrine against the constant threat of missile swarms to cover the entire airspace in the vicinity of the fleet from a longitudinal perspective with a large number of long-range point defense launchers and additional dark particle fluctuator.

However, the Moon Phase fighter's massive bulk, forcing it the deploy in squadrons of one, carries a sizable amount of point-defense weaponry, allowing it to meet the requirements by its lonesome.",,,
PLSP_subobject,SHIP,"A drone bomber, integrated into the Celestial Object Scholar to allow for surprise strikes on enemy ships.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
PLSP_meteoroid,SHIP,"The smallest design in the Polaris ship catalogue, the size of the Meteoroid shuttle does not limit its combat potential.

Surrounded by a set of physical devices and hard-coded with specially reinforced control equipment, the extra space is sacrificed to gain a range of energy systems far beyond what its exterior can seemingly support, while also supporting a standard firepower configuration. It is equipped to take up vacant spots in fleets that require small, highly mobile ships.

It is said that its front weapon slot and attached outline structure were designed with for the purpose of conducting heavy shock attacks.",,,
PLSP_crescent,SHIP,"For a seemingly fragile and vulnerable light frigate, the Crescent is anything but. On the contrary, its extremely well-designed architecture design provides the most flexible of combat capabilities for such a small volume.

If it is not possible for a Crescent's weapon suite to complete the annihilate its target in a limited timeframe, the focused arc generator hidden behind the ship's bow will be enough to make even the strongest of star fortresses crumble, as it is capable of paralyzing unprepared opponents by firing multiple EM pulses in a split second.

The only drawback is its lack of hull struct, which prevents it from being the truly exemplary figure of an ideal Polaris-designed frigate. That said, this drawback does not prevent it from being a mainstay of the Polaris naval fleets, giving it a fairly siginficant strategic role.",,,
PLSP_quadrant,SHIP,"Quadrant-class frigates are not generally used in small-scale battles, instead acting as skirmishers that sow chaos in the enemy battleline on large fleet battles.

Underneath a seemingly ordinary data analysis interface, is buried its incalculable tactical potential. Rather than entering the battlefield for direct hunter-killer roles, it is more suited to conduct its skirmishing operations by means of its advanced Timestream Interference System, so as to disrupt enemy formations with little risk of destruction.

That said, even if its auxiliary capabilities are more fully emphasized, it is still difficult for captain to ignore the self-protective capabilities of its firepower configuration in emergency situations.",,,
PLSP_facula,SHIP,"As a mainline frigate of the Polaris fleet, the Facula-Class has a robust flux management system, a simple-to-operate weapon group and an emergency shield hardener.

The Borealis Veil provides incredibly powerful protection, but it is more noteworthy that it manages to pack the full output of a Fortress Shield system while utilising various other innovations to limit energy consumption.

Alongside its indispensible weapons loadout, it is capable of bringing many tactical benefits to the battlefield. Though it has a drawback of having a slower combat speed, the Facula-Class is still suitable for most fleet tasks that do not require facing off other frigates or strikecraft that are faster than it.",,,
PLSP_evolution,SHIP,"This modest frigate constitutes the vanguard of the Polaris fleet. The Evolution-Class is a classic choice for any sizable force thanks to its flexible loadout configuration and its Vortex Drive system.

Being the most common does not necessarily mean mediocrity, as shown by its shield co-stabilizer, integrated into the core of the energy band so that it provides direct defense no less than any ship of the same size. Utilising's a frigate's typical high maneuverability, together with a set of manuevering devices that penetrates the entire design, the Evolution-Class also has the ability to avoid direct combat with any difficult targets.

A benchmark design as significant as other worthy battle corvettes.",,,
PLSP_lightcone,SHIP,"The Lightcone-Class destroyer is a second-line design focusing on mid-to-long-range support capabilities. The compact central structure is occupied by a single hangar and dedicated flux pipelines for the main turret, though this configuration makes certain sacrifices to the ship's shield generator and combat readiness systems.

Compared to Polaris' usual emphasis on flux dissipative capacity, this huge destroyer has achieved a balance between load capacity and flux dissipators. In addition to its powerful attack capability, it has the Event Disturbance ship system that can act on light and small targets, providing additional protection capabilities.

Lastly, it attaches importance to the concept of dual engine setups, which directly affects the arrangement and angle of the engines, which limits the maximum speed, improves the degree of flight stability, and significantly increases maneuverability.",,,
PLSP_pemumbra,SHIP,"The Pemumbra-class destroyer, with its radical focus on rapid advances, reflects a different fighting style than most ships from Polaris.

Its several turrets and iconic Vortex Drive system that are fixedly pointing forward provides incomparable fast strike capabilities from its provided hardware, although the position of the shield generator will be limited by this layout. However, rather than a single ship cutting in from the side of the front, it is more suitable for group formation operations.

It is important to note that it has compromised on the the size of the flux stabllizer in favor of increasing the size of the core armor area, making it incredibly vulnerable to bursting strikes.",,,
PLSP_corona,SHIP,"Another type of auxiliary ship that influences the battle situation by regulating battlefield scenarios, the Corona-Class destroyer is able to hold the rear of the battle line while directly impacting enemy ships in the distance with terrifying efficiency and frightening momentum, forcing the opponent to maintain an inferior battle line.

Its design style has multiple turrets, and their firing angles coordinated to cover directions with almost no dead angles, providing all-round protection. In addition to that and its excellent damage control systems, its most outstanding feature is its expensive Solarwind subsystem. After complex operation processing, it can throws a large amount of high-heat material over a wide area at a speed that nothing in main space can avoid, emptying the battlefield of light armored units, slowing down the projectiles, and even targeting the formations of those ships that can resist its direct damage.

As one of the more stubborn designs in the Polaris arsenal, direct assault or frontal contact with it is often not recommended.",,,
PLSP_aberration,SHIP,"The Aberration-Class destroyer is an economical suppressive destroyer, renowned for performing better than most ships in high pressure battlefield conditions.

In order to alleviate the shortcomings of the flux-management system, this ship uses more missile weapon slots to reduce its dependence on its flux dissipators. The energy strike weapons are augmented by a set of highly complex time flow accelerators, further enhancing their capabilities.

It doesn't seem to be outstanding in terms of performance, but its overwhelming cost advantage and ease of assembly make it capable of defeating any opponent via a quantitative advantage.",,,
PLSP_blazar,SHIP,"Not a frontline combatant, this lightweight destroyer has the advantages of flexible turnover capabilities, alongside being capable of conducting chases and backline strikes.

It is also effective at escorting and evacuating small ships. The earliest forward-looking design that was equipped with auxiliary tactical systems in all of Polaris' contemporary designs, the Blazar-Class was initially positioned as a scout rather than for direct combat. Its superior maneuverability and highly customizable weapon array, combined with a shield generator sufficient to handle most situations, ensure that it returns safely from any danger.

Despite its various benefits, it is still not an asset that can confront the enemy directly. It is necessary to pay a close eye to its use in order to avoid unnecessary losses.",,,
PLSP_zodiac,SHIP,"The Zodiac-Class Freighter is a huge vehicle that integrates cargo and fuel transportation functions. Under low-speed adverse conditions, it has maintained logistic maintenance capabilities that generally exceed its average level of scale.

Use of the space film dispenser to compress and stabilize the cargo space allows for a storage capacity that would be unattainable under the same volume on standard ships, although this means that the travel speed over long distances is limited by the stabilizer. But it's all worth it for an integrated transport ship.

The protections around its engine block are sufficient to allow it to travel safely through more dangerous areas, resulting in its defensive weapon batteries existing only for a symbolic significance.",,,
PLSP_quasar,SHIP,"This elite cruiser, which breaks the balance between firepower and defense, is usually the backbone of a mobility-focused task force. The design of the Quasar-Class cruiser focuses on flash strikes and quick battles, allowing it to complete several tactical tasks in one shot.

Polaris ships, which make extensive use of bionics to design ship models, often suffer from fragile structures, and this radical cruiser design effectively compensates for this shortcoming with highly specialized assault capabilities. Whether it is supporting from a distance or maneuvering at short range, its outstanding performance under the hand of a skilled captain makes it a force to be reckoned with, earning a reputation for being the prime frigate hunter in the Polaris fleet. That is, if one is able to ignore the hefty and demanding supply requirements. ",,,
PLSP_spectrum,SHIP,"The Spectrum class cruiser can be considered a specialised 'glass cannon' light cruiser. For a ship of this size, it is far more vulnerable than most other conventional cruisers, but its highly valued long-range suppression capability will compensate for this as much as possible.

The relative lack of defensive capabilities does not mean that it can only be effective on small battlefields, for a common but vital emergency control system provides enough maneuverability at critical times, and whether it's for tactical evacuation or chasing nimble small targets, this superior design maximizes the effectiveness of every move.

Its post-battle maintenance process is also simpler than that of most cruisers of more complex construction, which has eased the logistical strain on Polaris while contributing to the mass assembly of the Spectrum class.",,,
PLSP_heliumflash,SHIP,"The result of a deliberate design choice to abandon the requirement for nimble manoeuvring and instead focusing on expanding the weapon loadout. Compared to other cruisers' balancing of a consistent combination of firepower, mobiliy and armor, the Heliumflash boasts an over-armed weapon group, accompanied by a tailor-made flux management system.

Original design documents of the Heliumflash-class cruiser initially described it as a battleship that could bring decisive suppressive firepower, but it was eventually downgraded to a cruiser due to cost, production and other reasons and hence its blueprint was designed as such. Hidden under its twisted shell is a highly developed network of energy channels and vents that improve dissipation efficiency. These parts are then combined with an attached AI core controller to ensure that it maintains firepower while maintaining a strong dissipation capacity, resulting in a hail of dense firepower that stops all who would dare approach the Heliumflash.

Despite having a shield with a poor operative efficiency, doctrine encourages captains to counterattack than passively defend, making use of its massive battlefield presence to force a conclusion.",,,
PLSP_collapse,SHIP,"The Collapse-Class cruiser has a volume slightly smaller than the average cruiser. Combined with a versatile firepower system, it utilizes a set of built-in shock equipment to cause large-scale area-of-effect damage.

Slow and bulky, thick armor and excellent anti-kinetic coating make up the ship's defenses, similar to the conventional scheme. However, the idea behind its flux dissipation system is heavily altered from that of the Polaris mainstream, and its flux capacitors are optimized for temporarily storing the excess flux energy generated by the Subspace Seismic Burst Generator.

A terrifying target for smaller vessels to face, any experienced frigate pack commander will quickly scatter the formation immediately after discovering that the enemy fleet has a Collapse-Class cruiser, as giving up the group advantage is far more preferable to the alternative. ",,,
PLSP_celestialobjectscholar,SHIP,"Unlike most carrier designs that emphasize seizing strikecraft superiority, Celestial Object Scholar(C.O.S.)-Class carriers are more focused on the encircling or circumventing of superior forces through the rapid micromanagement of orders throughout the battlefield.

This unconventional role is performed entirely by a set of target feeders hidden within the main control center, whose full-power real-time scanning data output is sufficient to ensure the success of any modest bombing campaign. It is worth noting that, in addition to the fighters it may carry, it is armed with an internal drone unit capable of activating a small-scale lightning strike against any enemy that dares to attack.

A large amount of intelligence and its distinct hull shape indicates that this particular design seems to have some connection with the ApproLight Council. Both sides remain silent on this.",,,
PLSP_flocculus,SHIP,"Considered as a super-heavy version of the Facula-Class frigate, the Flocculus-Class Battleship can alone recieve the same pressure as an entire small fleet and maintain the same battleline combat ability as any other capital class.

The shortcomings in flux dissipation do not hide the endurance of this behemoth, which compares favorably to most other capitals of the Sector. Its flux capacity and unusually thick structure can allow it to withstand intense pressure from enemy forces. In addition, its infamous Borealis Shroud can also help friendly forces defend against attacks outside their own range.

And in terms of firepower, no wise captain will ignore the three large turrets that are capable of tracking the same target.",,,
PLSP_meridian,SHIP,"The Meridian-Class Battle Cruiser is an over-specced high-speed battlecruiser. At the cost of lacking much structural protection, a large number of flux pipelines are installed in the core area for compatibility with the large frontal batteries. The consistent high-speed also allows it to move freely while engaged.

Polaris’ main doctrine relys on maintaining far greater pursuit and suppression capabilities than most other warships, while not being inferior to any larger tonnage in battle. The concession made in armor protection for the Meridian will not cause too much obstacle in its purpose of breaking into the enemy's battlegroup, demonstrating that traditional and classic designs are often the simplest and most efficient in some ways.",,,
PLSP_horizon,SHIP,"Contrary to the mainstream idea of overwhelming the enemy with quantity, Horizon-Class carriers are more focused on using a set of long-range amplification equipment to instantly enhance the battlefield capabilities of deployed fighters. In addition, its own highly efficient shield generator and power core means that this combat carrier is capable of filling in missing strikecraft at critical moments without regard to flux load.

As an avant-garde fighter carrier platform, its highly efficient miniature nanofactory and various auxillary systems show that it is not to be taken lightly. That said, given its high cost of manufacturing and maintenance, the Horizon is not seen often, meaning its rare deployment on the battlefield is a sign that Polaris very much wishes for a particular enemy to be exterminated.

It may be worth mentioning that this carrier doctrine of emphasizing quality over quantity, effectively reduces the attrition caused by the loss of fighters in the battlefield - although this is not the original intention of this policy.",,,
PLSP_transit,SHIP,"The Transit-Class battleship is one of the most magnificent battleships via the common specifications of the Sector, boasting incredible capabilities in exchange for its utterly ruinous maintainence cost.

In the battlefield, this robust yet sensitive battleship can respond quickly to targets in any direction with the help of a space displacer, while the standard weapon group and superior shield projector array, boast maximum protection and destructive capability at any point of combat.

A war machine that enters the battlefield only at the most necessary moment, no captain with a lick of sanity will be willing to face such a ruthless opponent without sizable support.",,,
PLSP_axis,SHIP,"This uncommon broadsiding battlecruiser has a high engine power and battlefield agility that differentiates it from tradtional Polaris doctrine. While simiar to the popular Conquest-Class Battlecruiser, it boasts an additional front facing tactical main gun and more capable shields.

Its clear that whole ship is designed around the characteristics of extreme firepower, seeing how its framework, a radical design utlising weapon link components to manage other modules, gives it the ability to carry the most destructive weapons. To make this heavy weapons platform more of a deterrence, Polaris designed a unique inertial afterburner system at the expense of nearly luxurious R & D costs, and added a relatively stable flux dissipator.

Its built-in main gun, so called Ether Strike, affectionally known as ""Guiding Star"" by some Polaris captains, seems to symbolize dissatisfaction with the existing reality and a compulsion for action.",,,
PLSP_magnitude,SHIP,"The Magnitude-Class is a special carrier designed to ensure high survivability in a complex airspace environment, following a defensive philosophy, but its unique shape makes it take up attention outside of its traditional role.

Its compact main body conceals two sets of direct external deck mounted aircraft assembly lines to function as an effective hangar with minimal space requirements and reduce the potential risk of improper maintenance. It also boasts a set of emitter links, which can regulate its strikecraft vulnerable shield cores for maximum performance while the equipment is sufficiently cooled, making them immune to most conventional attack threats.

However, the more moderate speed compared to other ships of its size limits its engagement ability. But this shortcoming, as noted by observers, is actually an integral part of the Polaris fleet doctrine.",,,

plsp,FACTION,"'Polaris', full name being 'Polaris Prime', refers to an enigmatic faction whose first and most prominent action was the sudden invasion and capture of the Triglav system, which at that point was pending recolonization as part of an independent effort. Due to the chaos of the Second AI War, the Polaris initial capture of the system was left unimpeded, and when the ceasefires were called the war exhaustion within the various factions caused them to merely acknowledge the existence of the 'new' faction and agree to mutual non-aggression pacts.

Polaris' rather insular attitude means that it has not attracted much public attention since then, a boon for most factions who simply lacked the energy to confront a new organization with hiterio unknown technologies in their possession. Most save the Sindrian Diktat, whose military leaders precieved it as a weakness to take advantage of. The resulting conflict has sunk into a stalemate as the fearsome opening Sindrian assault was halted by Polaris' exotic arsenal, resulting in a fierce cold war that continues to this day.

Currently rumours circulate that Polaris is in possession of unique FTL communications technology that allows them to communicate outside of the Sector, but as the organization's isolationist stance continues, these rumours will (hopefully) remain rumours...",,,
